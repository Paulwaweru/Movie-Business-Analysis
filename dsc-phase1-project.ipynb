This project aims at exploring the types of films produced in the industry, and their respective perfromance in the box office. An analysis of this performance will provide Microsoft with insights, which will enable them decide on the type of films to create.\n",

Also, the highest grossing studios are likely to be Microsoft's main competitors, thus analyzing the type of films they produce can provide a picture of the type of films Microsoft should produce, and the type of films to avoid.\n",
